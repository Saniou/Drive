# Project "Drive"
### Description:
The "Drive" project is inspired by the cult movie "Drive," featuring Ryan Gosling in the lead role. This project aims to recreate the atmosphere of the film and showcase technical solutions based on a fictional navigation system derived from the movie's locations.

### Key Features:
"Drive" Navigation: Utilizes a technical stack to display locations and navigate places from the movie.
Interactive Input Fields: Input pickup and drop locations to build a route.

### Technologies:
The project is built using modern web technologies and leverages the following tools:

* Frontend: Uses React and Next.js to implement the client-side.
* Mapping API: Incorporates Mapbox services for geodata retrieval and visualization.

### Notes:
This project is a showcase of technical skills in replicating concepts from the "Drive" movie. It is not associated with a real navigation service or practical application.
